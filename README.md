**EvaQuake-App**

**Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to create EvaQuake, an application designed to help enhance earthquake preparedness, response, and situational awareness for Victorino Mapa High School students.


**Key Features & Objectives**

The application is being developed with the following specific goals:
- **Augmented Reality (AR) Evacuation Navigation:** This feature uses QR code markers as AR anchors to provide real-time directional cues, visual overlays for hazard zones, and safe routes toward exits within the school.
- **Interactive 3D School Model:** A detailed 3D model of the school's indoor layout will highlight key areas like exits, stairwells, and hazard-prone zones. It will also embed earthquake preparedness learning materials and safety tips.
- **Student Status and Attendance Monitoring**: An integrated feature will allow teachers and administrators to track and update students’ conditions as “safe,” “missing,” or “in danger” during earthquake drills and real-world events.

**Technologies Used**

The project leverages the following technologies:
- Android Studio: The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- Java/Kotlin: The core programming languages for the app's logic.
- Node.js: The backend server environment for handling API requests.
- ARCore/ARKit: For implementing the Augmented Reality functionalities.
- 3D Modeling Software: Used to create the interactive school layout.
- Firebase/Firestore: Utilized for real-time data synchronization and student monitoring.
- Git/GitHub: Employed for version control and collaborative development.
