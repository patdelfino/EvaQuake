EvaQuake-App
Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to create EvaQuake, an application designed to help enhance earthquake preparedness as well as the response and situational awareness of Victorino Mapa High School students.

Key Features & Objectives
The application is being developed with the following specific goals:

Augmented Reality (AR) Evacuation Navigation: Implement an AR evacuation navigation system using QR code markers as AR anchors placed within the school. The application will provide real-time directional cues, visual overlays for hazard zones, and safe routes toward exits.

Interactive 3D School Model: Design and develop an interactive 3D model of Victorino Mapa High School, detailing its indoor layout, rooms, and facilities. The model will include marked legends to highlight key areas such as exits, stairwells, and hazard-prone zones. It will also embed earthquake preparedness learning materials and visual safety tips to support instructional goals.

Student Status and Attendance Monitoring: Integrate a feature that allows teachers and administrators to track and update students’ conditions as “safe,” “missing,” or “in danger” during earthquake drills and real-world events.

Technologies Used
Android Studio: The official IDE for Android development.

Java/Kotlin: The primary programming languages for the app's logic.

Node.js: The backend server environment for handling API requests and server-side logic.

ARCore/ARKit: For implementing the Augmented Reality features.

3D Modeling Software: For creating the interactive school layout.

Firebase/Firestore: For real-time data synchronization and student monitoring.

Git/GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
